Idea of having a stateless machine. Being able to be up and running on a new machine with all my configuration in seconds. All is needed is a container runtime (Rancher Desktop, Podman etc.)

## Tooling

- Mise
- Chezmoi
- Devcontainers
- Github Codespace


## The recommended path

Start with basics - `bash` and `vim`. Later in this course we move to `zsh`. Use `vim` for everything.

Use vim key bindings wherever possible (IDEA, K9s ....)
