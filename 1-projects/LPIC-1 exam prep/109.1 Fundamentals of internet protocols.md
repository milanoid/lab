### TCP/IP

Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol

Includes UDP, ICMP, DNS and many others, but in short we call it TCP.

#### IP

- unique IP address of a host IPv4, IPv6

4.2.2.4
|  |  |  | - 4th octet
|  |  | --- 3rd octet
|  | ----- 2nd octet
|-------- 1st octet (8 bits)

- each octet range 0 .. 255
- total 2^32 addresses 
- NAT or IP masquerade to overcome the IPv4 limit of number of addresses

_IANA_ - Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
- different IP address classes - A, B, C:

```
1.0.0.0 .. 126.255.255.255 - class A
128.0.0.0 .. 191.255.255.255 - class B
192.0.0.0 .. 223.255.255.255 - class C
```


_Private range_

192.168.x.x - 65k IPs
172.16-31.x.x - 1M IPs
10.0-255.x.x - 16M IPs

IPv6

- 2^128 - address
- represented with Hex (base 16)

`2001:0db8:0a0b:12f0:0000:0000:0000:0001` - 8 groups of hex

shorter version of the same: `2001:db8:a0b:12f0::1`
