## Hypervisor

A layer between virtualized resources (CPU, RAM, Storage) and actual HW.

#### Hypervisor type 1 vs type2

Type 2 - "Hosted"

- e.g. running VM in VirtualBox (having role of hypervisor) on a host OS (my Mac OS)
- examples: VirtualBox, VMWare

Type 1 - "Native" or "Bare matal"

- Hypervisor runs directly on the HW (one layer less)
- examples: KVM (in linux kernel), Xen, Hyper-V

#### VM Create and Clone

- OVF (Open Virtualization Format) - allows to move VMs between Hypervisors
- OVA (Open Virtualization Archive) 
- also there are templetes

#### Host specific configuration

- Hostname
- NIC MAC address
- Machnine ID
- Storage UUID
- any other UUID in the system

`cat /etc/machine-d`

#### Containers

Newer concept, also called OS level virtualization. Slimmer than full VMs. A container uses underlying OS.

#### IaaS

Infrastructure as a Service. Cloud service providers - AWS, Google Cloud, MS Azure. Buying resources like electricity.

`cloud-init` - helps to set up a cloud machine. https://cloud-init.io/
