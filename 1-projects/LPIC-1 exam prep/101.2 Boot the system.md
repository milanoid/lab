## The Boot Process

1. motherboard _Firmware_ does PowerOnSelfTest (POST)
2. motherboard loads the _bootloader_
3. _bootloader_ loads _Linux Kernel_ based on its configs
4. _Kernel_ (_initramfs_) loads and prepare the system (root filesytem) and runs init programs
5. _Init_ start the service, other programs


### Firmwares

BIOS
- older, from HDD the MBR (1 sector) is used

UEFI
- modern
- specify a dedicated disk partition for bootloader called EFI System Partition (ESP)
- ESP has FAT filesystem, size could be like 1G
- mounted to `/boot/efi`, bootloader files `.efi` extension

### Bootloader

- initialises the minimum hardware needed to boot the system and finds and runs the OS
- common Linux bootloader is `grub` (default for Ubuntu/Debian) also `systemd-boot` (in my Arch installation)

### Kernel

- the core of OS, the LINUX itself
- Kernel needs some initial information on drivers for HW - these are in `initramfs`

#### `initramfs`

Temp root files system loaded into memory, acts as a bridge between the bootloader and the actual root filesystem, contains essential tools, drivers and modules to mount the real root filesystem.

Kernel shows the boot process logs during the boot. It might be covered by a splash screen (just hit `ESC` key to show the logs).
## Commands

`dmesg` - show the full data from `kernel ring buffer`
