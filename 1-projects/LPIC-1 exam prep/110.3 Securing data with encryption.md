### Key Pairs

asymmetric cryptography - public and private keys

- no need for a secure channel (unlike the symmetric cryptography)
- others can encrypt their message to me using my public key
- only owner of the private key can decrypt that message

### ssh keys

- also based on the public, private keys
- MITM - man in the middle attach

```
milan@jantar ~ $ ssh milan@localhost
The authenticity of host 'localhost (::1)' can't be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:sWhvmhyX0MkrItD0zbiEFGjyv9DlbQxD3GcUX5eikzY.
This key is not known by any other names.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?
```

`~/.ssh/known_hosts`

If fingerprint has changed the old record can be removed by `ssh-keygen -R <server>`,

e.g. `ssh-keygen -R localhost`

#### creating your own key pairs

`ssh-keygen` - OpenSSH authentication key utility

algorithms
	- `dsa` - obsolete, do not use
	- `ecdsa` - good one
	- `ed255519` - even better
	- `rsa` - usually default (e.g. used by bitcoin)

#### usage - ssh password-less login

`~/.ssh/authorized_keys` - users with public keys in this file can login w/o password

`ssh-copy-id` - copy the public key to a remote server

```
milan@jantar ~/.ssh $ ssh-copy-id -i ./id_ed25519.pub milan@localhost
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: Source of key(s) to be installed: "./id_ed25519.pub"
The authenticity of host 'localhost (::1)' can't be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:sWhvmhyX0MkrItD0zbiEFGjyv9DlbQxD3GcUX5eikzY.
This key is not known by any other names.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys
```

#### run a command via ssh


```
milan@jantar ~ $ ssh milan@localhost uptime
 19:04:19 up  5:28,  2 users,  load average: 1.43, 1.16, 1.08
```

#### ssh-agent

`ssh-agent` - OpenSSH authentication agent

- for cases when the private key is using a password, I would have to provide password every time I use the key. That's against the idea of password-less login
- it keeps the keys in memory, asks for password once
- it can also  _transfer_ the keys

----
### ssh tunnels, X forwarding

#### local tunnel

`ssh -L 9000:hckrnews.com:80 milan@localhost`

- starts listening on my machine on port 9000
- ssh connects to (remote) machine `milan@localhost`
- `curl localhost:9000` will run the command on the ssh remote machine and opens web address `hckrnews.com`

```
milan@jantar ~ $ curl localhost:9000
<!DOCTYPE html>

<h1>Welcome to nginx!</h1>

working. Further configuration is required.</p>

```

Who is using port 9000? Use `fuser` command:

```
milan@jantar ~ $ fuser 9000/tcp -v
                     USER        PID ACCESS COMMAND
9000/tcp:            milan     16118 F.... ssh
```


`ssh -L` - local tunneling, common usage together with so called jump host servers

jumphost
|   |   | --- --- webserver3 (running app at `monitor:8080`)
|   | 
|   | --- webserver2
| --- webserver1

`ssh -L 9000:monitor:8080 user@jumpshot`

#### remote tunnel

also called reverse tunnel

`ssh -R 9000:localhost:80 root@server`

 usage: I'm developing a web app on my localhost, I want others to be able to access 


#### common switch when tunneling

`-N` - no login, just tunnel
`-f` - run ssh in the background
`-D` - dynamic port forward


##### Socks proxy

`ssh -D 1080 server` - localhost will listen on port 1080 (Socks Proxy)

- whatever request goes to port `1080` on my machine is forwarded to `server`
- the response is sent from `server` to my machine

### X Forwarding

X11 protocol for GUI

`ssh -X server`

### Encryption and signing data with GPG

`gpg` - OpenPGP encryption and signing tool

- Pretty Good Privacy - `pgp`
- open version of `pgp`

`gpg --gen-key` - generate key


```
milan@jantar ~ $ gpg --gen-key
gpg (GnuPG) 2.4.7; Copyright (C) 2024 g10 Code GmbH
This is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.
There is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.

Note: Use "gpg --full-generate-key" for a full featured key generation dialog.

GnuPG needs to construct a user ID to identify your key.

Real name: Milan Vojnovic
Email address: email@address.com
You selected this USER-ID:
    "Milan Vojnovic <email@address.com>"

Change (N)ame, (E)mail, or (O)kay/(Q)uit? O
We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.

```

`gpg --export -a milan > milan.pub.key` - export my public key
`gpg --import others-file.key` - import others key

Now we can securely communicate, e.g. via email.

#### revoking keys

- in case of being compromised

#### gpg-agent

- just like ssh-agent
- keeps my gpg keys in memory
