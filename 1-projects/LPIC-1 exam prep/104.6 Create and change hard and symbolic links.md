### Hard vs Soft links

#### hard 

- an entry that points to the same _inode_ as the source file
- like creating another name for the same file
- no copying a file just adding another path that refers to the identical data
- changing file access rights (e.g. `chmod +x)` will change it for "both"
- cannot link directories
- cannot link across different file systems


`ln /tmp/source_file /tmp/source_file_hard_link`

note - the hard link looks like a regular file
```
milan@jantar ~/Downloads $ ls -la | grep source_file
-rw-r--r--  2 milan milan       0 Jun  4 13:05 source_file
-rw-r--r--  2 milan milan       0 Jun  4 13:05 source_file_hard_link
```


#### soft

- also called symbolic link
- create a new _inode_
- can link directories
- can link across different file systems
- creates a separate file that contains the path to another file

`ln` - make links between files

```
ln -s source_file source_file_soft_link
```

note the diff in access rights between the file and the link
```
-rw-r--r--  1 milan milan       0 Jun  4 13:05 source_file
lrwxrwxrwx  1 milan milan      11 Jun  4 13:22 source_file_soft_link -> source_file
```

symbolic link can be found and listed by `find . -type l`
