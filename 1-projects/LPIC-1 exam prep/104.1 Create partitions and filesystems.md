`MBR` vs `GPT`

terms:
- partition, partition type
- mbr, gpt
- block device

### Block devices

- non-volatile mass storage
- accessed by any order
- hard disk (HDD) or (SSD), USB flash disk, DVD


### MBR and fdsik

`MBR` 
- master boot record
- for BIOS (legacy)
- `fdisk` for partitioning

MBR can have either _primary_ or _extended_ partition. Max 4 _primary_ partitions.

#### fdisk

`# fdisk /dev/sda`

commands:

- `w` - write changes
- `p` - print current partition table
- `n` - create a new partition
- `F` - show unallocated space (F-free)
- `d` - delete a partition
- `t` - change partition type
- `l` - list all available partition types

Mind the Gap!

Keep in mind that when creating a new partition with fdisk, the maximum size will be limited to the maximum amount of **contiguous** unallocated space on the disk.

### GPT

`GPT`
- GUID partition table
- for UEFI (new)
- `gdisk`  for partitioning
- each disk has GUID (unique identifier)
- up to 128 partitions

Physically connect a device (e.g. a new SSD) triggers `udev` which adds that device to `/dev` directory.

`parted`  - edits partition (not possible by fdisk)
`gparted`

#### gdisk

commands, same as fdisk:

- `p` - print partition table
- `n` - create a new partition
- `l` - list all available partition types (more than fdisk)
- `d` - delete partition
- `s` - sort partitions (to avoid gaps in numbering)
- `b`, `c`, `d`, `e` - recovery options
- `f` - convert GPT to MBR

Unlike MBR a partition does NOT have to use **contiguous** unallocated space only. It can use every bit available anywhere.

### Creating File System

Once a device is partitioned we need to format it with a filesystem.

Examples: fat32, ext4, swap, btrfs

terms:
- `journal` - prevents an issue when crash/power outage during write operation
- `uuid` - 

tools

#### ext 

- `mkfs` - build a Linux filesystem
- `mkfs.ext2`, `mkfs.ext3`, `mkfs.ext4` (symbolic links to `mke2fs)
- `mke2fs -t ext4 /dev/sdb1`

#### XFS

- a high-performance filesystem
- _log_ (journal) and _data_ sections
- `mkfs.xfs /dev/sda1`


#### FAT, VFAT

- mkfs.fat
- FAT 16 - volumes limit 4GB
- FAT 32 - volume limit 2PB
- old but working everywhere, for flashdisks etc

#### exFAT

- 2006 by Microsoft
- volume limit 128PB
- `mkfs.exfat`
#### Btrfs

- B-Tree Filesystem, pronounced as “Butter FS” or “Better FS”
- 2007 by Oracle, RH, Intel, SUSE
- transparent compression (ZLIB, LZO, ZSTD)
- snapshots and quotas
- subvolumes (filesystems inside filesystems)
- very resilient to crashes
- default for SUSE
- `mkfs.btrfs`

### GNU Parted

`parted` 
- partition editor
- create, delete, move, resize, rescue and copy partitions

truth statements

- It is a filesystem type.
- It has its own integrated RAID functionality.
- It can have subvolumes that are mounted separately from other subvolumes.
- It can have file-based transparent compression.


### Swap

- `mkswap /dev/sda2`
- `swapon /dev/sda2`

Also swap files are supported on Linux:

```bash
$ dd if=/dev/zero of=myswap bs=1M count=1024
1024+0 records in
1024+0 records out
1073741824 bytes (1.1 GB, 1.0 GiB) copied, 7.49254 s, 143 MB/s

# mkswap myswap
# swapon myswap
```
#### Experiment

todo

create a partition of a type Linux and try to format it as ntfs - what error if any it produces?

```
Disk /dev/sdb1: 4 GiB, 4294967296 bytes, 8388608 sectors
Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
Disklabel type: dos
Disk identifier: 0x00000000
```

```
milan@ubuntu:~$ sudo mkfs.ntfs /dev/sdb1 
Cluster size has been automatically set to 4096 bytes.
Initializing device with zeroes: 100% - Done.
Creating NTFS volume structures.
mkntfs completed successfully. Have a nice day.
```

Seems the `mkfs.ntfs` changes the type from Linux to `dos` when formatting.


Which of the following are ways by which you can identify a filesystem in the /etc/fstab file?

- device file name
- UUID
- label

In the /etc/fstab file, what are the options used for a record, when options is set to defaults?

- dev
- nouser
- rw

```
The kernel default is usually 
rw, 
suid, 
dev, 
exec, 
auto, 
nouser,
async.
```
