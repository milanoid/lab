Terminal emulater - application running in GUI emulating text terminal.

```
milan@ubuntu:~$ readlink /bin/sh
dash
milan@ubuntu:~$ echo $SHELL
/bin/bash
milan@ubuntu:~$ type cd
cd is a shell builtin
milan@ubuntu:~$ which ls
/usr/bin/ls
milan@ubuntu:~$ whatis ls
ls (1)               - list directory contents
milan@ubuntu:~$ whereis ls
ls: /usr/bin/ls /usr/share/man/man1/ls.1.gz
```

### man pages

`man <section_id> program`, e.g. `man 2 uname`

#### apropos

`apropos ` - search the manual page names and descriptions

#### type

```bash
milan@ubuntu:~$ type uname
uname is hashed (/usr/bin/uname)
```

- `hashed` - it means the command has run before and is "hashed" for better performance in next run
- to cleanup a hash table run `hash -d`

### which

`which` - locate a command

```bash
milan@ubuntu:~$ which uname
/usr/bin/uname
```

### command history

`~/.bash_history`

`history 5` - prints 5 the most recent commands

```bash
milan@ubuntu:~$ history
    1  clear
    2  sudo su -
    3  cat /etc/machine-id
    4  fdf
    5  xeyes
    6  man xeyes
```

`!6` - run a command from history (`man eyes`)

```
milan@jantar ~/repos/lab(main) $ echo $HISTFILE
/home/milan/.bash_history
```

or `history` command
- than `!52` for a command on a specific history id
- or `!!` for very last command
- or `!tmp` - run a last command with `tmp` in it

also CTRL-r for backward search


exiting the shell `exit` or `CTRL-b`

### Variables

#### creating a variable
`VARIABLE_NAME=variable_value`
`echo $VARIABLE_NAME`

#### deleting a variable

```
unset myvar
```


`env` - prints all shell variables
`set` - prints all + some functions

`export NAME=milan` - with `export` the variable survive after invoking `bash`in `bash`

add my directory to `PATH`: `PATH=$PATH:/my-directory`

In linux the current directory is not part of the path! Which is a good approach unlike on Windows as a hacker might create a executable with malicious code, e.g. `ping`. When running `ping` in a directory with that malicious file it will be run instead the system `ping`.

when invoking a command linux search for it:

1. is it a bash internal command?
2. is it in directory specified in `$PATH`
3. command not found


### special characters

escaping or quoting by `\`, e.g. `\*`

#### double quotes
```bash
$ touch "my big file"

$ ls

'my big file'
```

#### single quotes

```bash
$ rm 'my big file'
```

```
(Note that single quotes will preserve the literal value of all characters, while double quotes will preserve all characters except for $,`, \ and, on certain cases, !.)
```

#### backslash

```bash
touch my\ big\ file
```
---

#### uname

`uname` - print system information


Print kernel name only (OS name)
```
milan@ubuntu:~$ uname
Linux
```

```
milan@ubuntu:~$ uname -s
Linux

```

```
milan@ubuntu:~$ uname --kernel-name
Linux

```

Print kernel version

```
milan@ubuntu:~$ uname -v
#15-Ubuntu SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Sun Apr  6 14:37:51 UTC 2025
```


Which of the following environment variables is an array variable?

`GROUPS`

To properly display its contents and see to which all the groups you belong is: 
`echo ${GROUPS[*]}`


```bash
milan@ubuntu:~/Documents$ echo ${GROUPS[*]}
1000 115 985 27
```
