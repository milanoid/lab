- each `user` belongs to one or more `group`s

`whoami` - print effective user name
`groups` - print the groups a user is in
`id` - print real and effective user and group IDs


```
milan@ubuntu:/$ groups milan
milan : milan sudo vboxsf
```

```
milan@ubuntu:/$ id
uid=1000(milan) gid=1000(milan) groups=1000(milan),27(sudo),985(vboxsf)
```

users and groups in `/etc/group` and `/etc/passwd`
```
milan@ubuntu:/$ cat /etc/group | grep milan
sudo:x:27:milan
vboxsf:x:985:milan
milan:x:1000:
```

```
milan@ubuntu:/$ cat /etc/passwd | grep milan
milan:x:1000:1000:milan:/home/milan:/bin/bash

```

### File ownership & permission

Linux uses 3 layers of access/permissions for each file:

- user
- group
- group & others

```
milan@ubuntu:/$ cat /etc/passwd | grep milan
milan:x:1000:1000:milan:/home/milan:/bin/bash
```

	- each file belongs to one user and one group

```
milan@ubuntu:~$ ls -lth .profile 
-rw-r--r-- 1 milan milan 807 Mar  5 02:35 .profile
```

position 1
- `-` - ordinary file
- `l` - links
- `d` - directory

position 2,3,4

- read, write and execute for `owner`

position 5,6,7

 - read, write, execute for group members

position 8,9,10

- read, write, execute access for other users

position 11

 - indicates if any other access methods are applied (SELinux)


### changing permissions

`chmod` - change file mode bits

- two ways - either `octal` (base 8) or shot codes

`octal`

- `0` - no access
- `1`  - execute
- `2` - write
- `4` - read

read+execute `4` + `1` which is `5`

| Symbolic | Octal |
| :------: | :---: |
|   rwx    |   7   |
|   rw-    |   6   |
|   r-x    |   5   |
|   r--    |   4   |
|   -wx    |   3   |
|   -w-    |   2   |
|   --x    |   1   |
|   ---    |   0   |
example:

`rwx` to the owner, `rx` to the group and only `x` to others, you have to use `751`

`chmod 751 my-file`

another easier method

`u` - user
`g` - group
`o` - others

`+x` - execute permissions
`+r` - read permissions
`+w` - write permissions

example:

`chmod u+x` - grants execute permission to user

`chmod -R o+r /tmp` - recursive on all files in a directory


#### changing owner and groups

`chown` - change file owner and group

`chown user:group`

`chown -R user:group /tmp`


`chgrp` - change group ownership

`usermod` - modify a user account

User can be member of multiple groups - to set a default group use `newgro`

`newgrp` - log in to a new group


#### access modes

`suid`
`sgid`

- `s`

If these bits are set on a file, that file will be executed with the access of the **owner** (or **group**) of the file and not the user who is running it.

Allows me to run e.g. `passwd` to change my own password albeit the owner is `root:root`.

_sticky bit_

- makes the file resistant to deletion!
- `t` in last bit
- if set only the owner can delete it (even if others have write access)
- useful for `/tmp` - where all have write access but we don't want others to delete our files


#### umask

`umask` - set file mode creation mask

- specifies what permissions are not set

example:

the newly created file won't have `x` for executable (0002)

```
milan@ubuntu:/tmp$ umask
0002
milan@ubuntu:/tmp$ touch milan.log
milan@ubuntu:/tmp$ ls -lah milan.log 
-rw-rw-r-- 1 milan milan 0 Jun  3 12:32 milan.log
```
