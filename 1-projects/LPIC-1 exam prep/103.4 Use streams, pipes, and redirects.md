### stream

a stream - e.g. output of `ls` command

- `stdin - 0 also `/dev/stdin`
- `stdout - 1 also ``/dev/stdou`
- `stderror - 2 ``/dev/stderror`

0, 1, 2 are _file descriptors_


### Redirections

operators

- `>` - redirect to a file, e.g. `ls > file.txt`, overwrites the file if exists
- `>>` - the same as `>` but *append*
- `2>>file`
- `2>`  - redirect _stderror_ to a file, e.g. `ls -la XX* 2>> /tmp/error`
- `2>>`
- `&>` - redirect both stdout and _stderror_ to a file
- `&>>`
- `<` - redirect stdin from a file
- `<>` - redirect stdin from a file and redirect the stdout to it

#### here-document

- useful for writing scripts

e.g. run ftp commands until it reaches END keyword (does not have to be END but anything)
```bash
ftp < '''END
command1
command2
command3
END
```

#### here-string

for one-liners - note `<<<`

```bash
$ wc -c <<<"How many characters in this Here string?"

41
```

### Pipes

`command1 | command2` - redirects stdout of first command to `stdin` of seconds command

```
milan@SPM-LN4K9M0GG7 /tmp $ ls -1 | wc -l
      26
```

### xargs

`xargs` - construct argument list(s) and execute utility
```bash
milan@SPM-LN4K9M0GG7 /tmp $ ls | xargs -I KEYWORD echo these KEYWORD are files
these com.apple.launchd.WDLRJtMlM9 are files
these com.brave.Browser.Sparkle.pid are files
```

```bash
milan@SPM-LN4K9M0GG7 ~/Documents/lpic-playground $ seq 1 9 | xargs -L3 echo
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
```

### tee 

- duplicate standard input

`ls | tee file` - duplicates stream to stdout AND `file`

- `a` switch to append

Example
```bash
echo "Hello World" | tee output.txt
```

**Result:**

- Displays "Hello World" on the screen
- Writes "Hello World" to `output.txt`
