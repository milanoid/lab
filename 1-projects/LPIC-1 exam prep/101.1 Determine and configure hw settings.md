### Operating System

- SW layer between HW and user applications (user space programs)
- provides high level abstraction for user applications so they don't need to deal with HW details
- manages HW resources (memory, I/O)

### Firmware

Software <-> Firmware <-> Hardware
- running on hardware, keyboards, motherboards all have its firmware
- BIOS (legacy), now UEFI (originally known as EFI by Intel 1998+)

#### BIOS

- reads first sector of a storage device (HDD) - also known as Master Boot Record (MBR) - very small
- two stage booting process

#### UEFI

- boots from a dedicated partition `/boot` (with FAT filesystem), can be like 1G large

### Peripherals

PCI - Peripheral Component Interconnect

For connecting video cards, NIC, etc.

Variants
- PCI-Express (PCIe)
- 32-bit PCI
- PCI-X

#### HDD

- old spinning disks
- PATA (very old)
- SATA (serial for up to 4 devices)
- SCSI (parallel for up to 8 devices)

#### USB

usb-c now up to 20 Gbps


#### GPIO

General Purpose Input Output

Raspberry Pie computer - a single board computer (SBC)

How Linux sees the HW

- concept of pseudo file (exposed by kernel in format of a file)

### sysfs

- mounted under `/sys` mount point
- there are pseudo files representing the HW as the kernel sees it
- each type having its own category (directory), e.g. all block devices under `block`
- e.g. CPU in `/sys/bus/cpu/devices/cpu0`



### udev

- userspace `/dev` is a device manager fro the Linux kernel
- handles all user space events raised when HW device is added or removed to/from system (e.g. loading firmware)
- custodian form the `/dev` directory
- reading/writing on `character device` (c) or `block device` (d)

### dbus

- message bus system
- way of applications can talk to one another
- coordinates process lifecycle

### /proc directory

- created in RAM, pseudo files (some might have write access)
- things like Processes, IRQs, I/O ports, DMA (direct memory access), network settings

	cat /proc/cpuinfo

## lsusb, lspci, lsblk, lshw

`lsusb` - shows all connected usb devices
`lspci` - all PCI devices
`lsblk` - all block devices (disks)
`lshw` - extensive hw report

- `lsblk -f` - display system disks, partitions, and their associated filesystems
- the `/proc/filesystems` file contains filesystems **supported** on your system.
## Loadable Kernel Modules

- kernel has **most** of the drivers (modules) included
- drivers are `.ko` files
- loadable - loaded only if needed, to not have kernel bloated

`lsmod` - Show the status of modules in the Linux Kernel
`rmmod` - Program to remove a module from the Linux Kernel
`insmod` - Program to insert a module into the Linux Kernel

`modprobe` - convenient tool to add/remove modules from the Linux Kernel

If a module needs to be loaded every time system boots do one of the following:

1. add their name to file `/etc/modules`
2. add their config file to `/etc/modprobe.d`
