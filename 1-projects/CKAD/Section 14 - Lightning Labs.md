- [x] Task 1

create a PV with PVC 

- use labels to match PV with PVC (there are other methods, read [doc](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/))
- the pvc was bounded but a misleading error

```
Warning  ProvisioningFailed  2m6s (x5 over 2m51s)  persistentvolume-controller  no volume plugin matched name: kubernetes.io/no-provisioner
```

create pod and mount the pvc

#### follow ups

1. how to pv and pvc binding works?
2. what are the methods to tell which pv to use by a pvc?
