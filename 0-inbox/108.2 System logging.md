Central logging system - all applications log into it instead reinventing the wheel (log rotation and other problems).

older systems - `syslog` and `syslog-ng`
nowdays - `rsyslog` and `journalctl` (systemd)

`/dev/log` - the place to write in by an application, logging system reads it from it and process it

#### Kernel Ring Buffer

Inside kernel is Kernel Ring Buffer (memory place able to hold a lot of logs). Holds log messags before the kernel is able to write log to disk (in very beginning of boot process).

`dmesg` - show the kernel ring buffer

### common logs

- `/etc/log/auth.log`
