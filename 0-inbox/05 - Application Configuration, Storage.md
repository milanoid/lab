Excercise:

- Try adding a PersistentVolumeClaim to your GitOps configuration with the name linkding-data-pvc.
- Don't specify a storageclass, and use size 1Gi.
- Next, add the persistentVolumeClaim to your Deployment manifest.
- Need a refresh? Check out the storage modules in the Kubernetes Fundamentals course.

Bonus:

- Describe the pod and exec into the container to verify that the storage has been mounted.
