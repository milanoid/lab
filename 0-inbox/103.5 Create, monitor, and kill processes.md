`xeyes`, `xclock`

`CTRL-c` vs `CTRL-z`

`CTRL-c` - breaks the program
`CTRL-z` - stops the program (xeyes window still up)

```
milan@ubuntu:~$ xeyes 
^C
milan@ubuntu:~$ xeyes 
^Z
[1]+  Stopped                 xeyes

```

`jobs` - lists jobs

to resume a stopped job:

`fg %1` - `fg` for _foreground_

`bg %1` - `bg` for background

```
milan@ubuntu:~$ bg %1
[1]+ xeyes &
milan@ubuntu:~$ jobs
[1]+  Running                 xeyes &
```

`xeyes &` - run the `xeyes` in background

Issue - all the processes and jobs are running inside the shell. If I close the terminal emulator window it all dies. Imagine doing that while ssh-ed to a server. `noghup` can solve it:


`nohup` - run a command immune to hangups, with output to a non-tty


`kill` - terminate or signal a process

```
     Some of the more commonly used signals:

     1       HUP (hang up)
     2       INT (interrupt)
     3       QUIT (quit)
     6       ABRT (abort)
     9       KILL (non-catchable, non-ignorable kill)
     14      ALRM (alarm clock)
     15      TERM (software termination signal)
```

`killall` - kill processes by name

`pkill` - find or signal processes by name

`ps` - process status
