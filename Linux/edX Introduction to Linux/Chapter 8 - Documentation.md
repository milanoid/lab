- `man -f` - list all pages on the topic - same asi `whatis`
- `man -k` - list all pages that discuss the topic - same as `apropos`

The default order is specified in `/etc/man_db.conf` and is roughly (but not exactly) in ascending numerical order by section.

## GNU Info System

- a bit outdated but sometimes have more detailed description
- e.g. `man ls` vs `info ls`


## others

- `help` - synopsis of  built-in commands (e.g. `cd` or `echo`)
