### Unix directories

FHS - File Hierarchy Standard (one large tree-like model starting with root `/`)


- `/bin` - essential binaries (zip, less ...)
- `/boot` - static files of the boot loader
- `/dev` - device files (`hda`, `sda` ... )
- `/etc` - the most important - configuration files
- `/home` - home directory for users
- `/lib` - essential shared libraries
- `/media` - mount point for removable media
- `/mnt` - mount point for mounting a filesystem temporarily
- `/opt` - application software packages
- `/root` - home directory of the root user
- `/sbin` - essential binaries
- `/srv` - data for services provided by this system
- `/tmp` - temp files, deleted on boot
- `/usr` - secondary hierarchy (e.g. again `/bin`, `/lib`, `/sbin` ...)
- `/var` - variable files (logs)

### Partitions

`/dev/sda1` - first SATA disk, partition 1
`/dev/sdb1` - second SATA disk, partition 1

#### LVM

https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/LVM

- Logical Volume Manager
- physical volume (PV)
- volume group (VG)
- logical volume (LM)

swap - extra memory, size RAM + 2G or 4G

truth statements on LVM

- LVM uses logical volumes instead of directly using disk partitions.
- LVM logical volumes are made up portions from a single designated volume group.
- LVM volume groups are made up of one or more physical volumes.
- LVM physical volumes are actually disk partitions that have been designated to be a physical volume.

### Mount Points

before a filesystem can be accessed on Linux it needs to be _mounted_.  Mounting means attaching the filesystem to a specific point in system's directory tree, called _mount point_.

Directory I want to mount FS in must exists before mounting.

Good practices

- removable media to `/media` (it used to be `/mnt/cdrom`, `/mnt/floppy` etc.)
- whenever you need to manually mount something -> use `/mnt`


#### keeping things separated

Some directories is good to have on a separate partition.

- `/boot` - boot partition
- `/home` - user data
- `/var` - data for e.g. a webserver


### LVM

- form of storage virtualization

1. Basic unit is _Physical Volume_ (PV) - a block device like a disk partition or RAID array
2. PVs are grouped in _Volume Groups_ (VG) - abstraction,  seen as a single logical device
3. Each volume in _Volume Group_ is subdivided into fixed-sized pieces called _extents_'
4. VG can be subdivided into _Logical Volumes_ (LVs) - work in a similar way as partitions but with more flexibility
5.
