special characters in regex

- `.` - any character
- `*` - any number of characters 
- `.{4}` - any four characters
- `.{3,10}` - any 3 to any 10 characters
- `^` - start of the line
- `$` - end of the line
- `|` - OR
- `[abc]`
- `[a-z]`
- `[A-Z]`

shortcuts

- `[:alnum:]`
- `[:blank:]` - space and tab characters
- `[:digit:]`
- `[:upper:]`, `[:lower:]`
- `^(negation)`
- `\d`

regex is greedy - trying to match as much possible as it can

### grep

`grep` - print lines that match patterns

switches

`-c` - count
`-v` - reverse the search
`-n` - show line numbers
`-l` - show only filenames
`-i` - case insensitive
`-r` - recursively


- `grep -r 192.168 /etc/` - search all configuration file in /etc for the IP address starting with 192.168 recursively

```
milan@SPM-LN4K9M0GG7 ~/Documents/lpic-playground $ grep f[aui]n file.txt
fun
fin
fan
```

### regex vs extended regex

- `grep` - uses basic regex
- `grep -E` - switch to use extended regex, supports `|` (branches)
- `egrep` - same as `grep -E`

extended RE: `he|him` - matches a string with either `he` or `him` 

can be used with `find` for searching:

`find $HOME -regex '.*/\..*' -size +100M`


### grep 

- `-c --count` - how many times a match occurs
- `-i --ignore-case`
- `-f --file=FILE` - use file containing the regex to use
- `-n --line-number`
- `-v --invert-match`
- `-H or --with-filename` - Print also the name of the file containing the line.

`egrep` == `grep -E` (grep with extended RE)

`fgrep == grep -F` - Interpret PATTERNS as fixed strings, not regular expressions. 


### sed

- stream editor for filtering and transforming text

`sed -r` - use (advanced) regex

`sed` instructions are composed of a single character, e.g. `1d` - delete first line: 

```bash
milan@ubuntu:~/Downloads$ factor `seq 12`
1:
2: 2
3: 3
4: 2 2
5: 5
6: 2 3
7: 7
8: 2 2 2
9: 3 3
10: 2 5
11: 11
12: 2 2 3
milan@ubuntu:~/Downloads$ factor `seq 12` | sed 1d
2: 2
3: 3
4: 2 2
5: 5
6: 2 3
7: 7
8: 2 2 2
9: 3 3
10: 2 5
11: 11
12: 2 2 3
```


By far the most used sed instruction is `s/FIND/REPLACE/`:

```bash
milan@ubuntu:~/Downloads$ cat b
This is line 1
and this is line 2
and one more line 3
that's all
bye

milan@ubuntu:~/Downloads$ sed s/[123]/X/ b
This is line X
and this is line X
and one more line X
that's all
bye
```
